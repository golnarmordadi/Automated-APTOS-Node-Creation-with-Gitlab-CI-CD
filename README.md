Please use this project as an example to learn from, about making automation by CI/CD not to use as a reference to creating the latest APTOS blockchain node. Basis for starting working with the CI/CD automation intended to go to production. APTOS blockchain may get upgrade so the repository code will not support the latest node code.</p>

#### Lets get dig into the codes <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="rocket" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f680.png">ðŸš€</g-emoji>

1- This <code>/.gitlab-ci.yaml/</code> template allows you to automate creation of a container. For this template I used Rancher. After running this template you will be
able to deploy the container. Once deployment finished successfully you can see the logs and monitor it by the Rancher.

#### Predefined CI/CD Variables?

You can pass environment variables from one job to another job in a later stage through variable inheritance. These variables cannot be used as CI/CD variables to configure a pipeline, but they can be used in job scripts.

* <code>CI_COMMIT_SHA</code> variable means: The commit revision for which project is built
* I am using this <code>$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA</code> variable into <code>docker-compose</code> which means: The first eight characters of <code>CI_COMMIT_SHA</code>. By this I wanted to use <code>CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA</code> as part of directory name which were later pushed to the server by rsync. It should have returned short hash from current commit.
* <code>$CI_JOB_NAME</code> targets the job that need to be run by this config file.                                          
* <code>CI_JOB_TOKEN</code> : Token used for authenticating with GitLab Container Registry, downloading dependent repositories, authenticate with multi-project pipelines when triggers are involved, and for downloading job artifacts.                                            
* <code>$CI_REGISTRY</code> : I will return by this the address of GitLab's Container Registry.
* <code>$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE</code> : With GitLab, you can add a job to your pipeline to build Docker images, and push them to the built-in container registry. You can set to use previous image as a cache to speedup build process.
* <code>$CI_PROJECT_DIR</code> : The full path where the repository is cloned and where the job is run.
