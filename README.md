## Clean Code❤️

                   “Of course bad code can be cleaned up. But it’s very expensive.”
                   ―Robert C. Martin

```
Humans are the first people you writing code for them. We need to make sure that we're creating code that can be easily understand 
by everyone whether the reader is the author of the code or a new programmer by smile 😉
```
                  “You should name a variable using the same care with which you name a first-born child.”
                  ―Robert C. Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
#### What Is Clean Code?

* Written with human in mind                                              
* Names are easy to understand                                            
* Formatted consistently                                               
* Clearly communication


```
That's where 'Clean Code' principles come into play. By following them, you will ensure that you are 
creating code that will be understood.
